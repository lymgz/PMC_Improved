## Abstract
The analysis shows that these localized policies may lead to supply-demand imbalances and increased development opportunity costs. Moreover, the study suggests that flexible and context-specific regulatory frameworks could better enhance market stability and consumer welfare. By offering a comprehensive and scientifically rigorous evaluation of real estate presale supervision policies, this study underscores the importance of tailored regulatory approaches in addressing the unique challenges of different regions, thereby supporting more sustainable and balanced market development
